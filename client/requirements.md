## Packages
date-fns | Date formatting and relative time calculation
framer-motion | Smooth animations for status changes and page transitions
lucide-react | Icons (already in base, but emphasizing need)

## Notes
PWA manifest and service worker configuration will be handled by Vite/Replit plugins if available, otherwise basic responsive design is prioritized.
Authentication uses cookie-based sessions (credentials: "include").
